# Amadeus

This is a website meant to help students of Colt's Web Dev bootcamp with their common issues. It features a simple client side engine and holds articles that can be easily linked to and shared.

It is also a learning experience working in collaboration with members of a team.

## Astro

We used Astro because it's a perfect SSG for our use case. We wanted to use markdown as content for common issues, plus, Astro makes it easy to use a front-end framework we wanted.

## Lunrjs

We didn't intend to host a site that would have lots of traffic or one that required a dedicated server. Lunrjs provides us with a lightweight client-side search engine we can use for our project.
